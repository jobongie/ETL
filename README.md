# ETL 

    Two Data Sources were used to pull election data for this project, with the endgoal of comparing the 2016 Election Forecast vs the Final Results.

    This is to be accomplished by using a CSV containing Electoral College votes by state (with added CD's in the case of Maine and Nebraska). An API containing election forecasts and election results was queried to provide a snapshop of the forecasting accuracy.

    

## Data Sources

    A CSV was queried from the website "fivethirtyeight.com" 

    An API was requested from the website public.opendatasoft.com
